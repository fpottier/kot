(* This is a variant of the test in Deque. In this variant, we focus on the
   most essential operations. Furthermore, we introduce "batch" operations
   where one batch operation stands for a sequence of N atomic operations.
   This allows us to build very large data structures while consuming only
   a small amount of Monolith fuel. *)
