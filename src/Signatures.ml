(**The signature [BUFFER8] extends the signature [BUFFER] with extra
   operations. All of these operations are in principle redundant: that is,
   they can be implemented in terms of the basic operations offered by
   [BUFFER]. Nevertheless, it is useful to identify these operations, for two
   reasons: first, their use makes client code more readable; second, a direct
   implementation of these operations is more efficient than an indirect
   implementation in terms of the basic operations. *)
